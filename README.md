## Carlingo

## Project Description:
   This project aims to create a website that helps users find the second-hand car information from craigslist, in a more organized way. In this project, we will be writing web crawler to get all the information about the used cars on craigslist, creating a database from the information we crawled, and building a simple website that let the users get the information about the preferred used cars. More specifically, the users can put in some preferences, such as location, price range, car model, and the website will return a list of related cars from our database. Furthermore, we can update our database on a daily basis by running the crawlers through craigslist, so that we can get the relatively timely information from craigslist. The website is open for more functionalities, if time allowed.
